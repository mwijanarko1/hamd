## **Introduction to Interrogative Pronouns (أسماء الاستفهام)**

Interrogative pronouns in Arabic (**أسماء الاستفهام**) are words used to **ask questions**. They help in forming questions about **people, things, places, time, reasons, and methods**. These words do not change based on gender or number, making them easy to use.

For example:

* **من هذا؟** (*Who is this?*)  
* **ما اسمك؟** (*What is your name?*)  
* **أين تسكن؟** (*Where do you live?*)
