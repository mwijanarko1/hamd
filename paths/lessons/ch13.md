## **How to Form Ism Al-Zaman and Ism Al-Makan**

We derive **Ism Al-Zaman and Ism Al-Makan** from verbs by following specific patterns:

| Verb Type | Pattern for Ism Al-Zaman & Ism Al-Makan | Example (Noun of Time) | Example (Noun of Place) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Past tense verb (3 root letters)** | **مَفْعَل (Maf‘al)** | **مَوْلِد (Mawlid) – Time of birth** | **مَسْجِد (Masjid) – Place of prostration** |
| **Past tense verb (more than 3 letters)** | **مَفْعِل (Maf‘il) or مَفْعَل (Maf‘al)** | **مَدْخَل (Madkhal) – Time of entry** | **مَسْبَح (Masbah) – Swimming pool (place of swimming)** |

📝 **Key Notes:**
