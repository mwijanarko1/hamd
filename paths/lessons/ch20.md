# **Chapter 20: The Imperative (Part 2\) – Indirect Commands and Prohibitions**

In the previous chapter, we discussed **direct commands**, which are used when giving **instructions or orders directly** to someone. In this lesson, we will explore **indirect commands (الأمر غير المباشر)** and **prohibitions (النهي)** in Arabic.

---

## **1\. Indirect Commands (الأمر غير المباشر)**

Indirect commands are used to **give an order indirectly**, often by referring to a third person rather than speaking directly to the listener. In Arabic, indirect commands are often expressed using **لِــ (Li) \+ Present Tense Verb**.

### **Formation of Indirect Commands:**

* **لِ \+ فعل المضارع (Present Tense Verb)**  
* The verb is in **jussive (مجزوم) form**, meaning it **loses the final vowel if applicable**.

| Meaning | Direct Command | Indirect Command |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Let him write\! | اكتبْ\! | **لْيكتبْ\!** |
| Let her sit\! | اجلسي\! | **لْتجلسْ\!** |
| Let them go\! | اذهبوا\! | **لْيذهبوا\!** |
| Let me read\! | اقرأْ\! | **لأقرأْ\!** |

### **Examples in Sentences:**

* **لْيذهبْ إلى المسجد.** → *Let him go to the mosque.*  
* **لْنكتبْ الدرس معًا.** → *Let’s write the lesson together.*  
* **لْيجلسْ الطلاب في أماكنهم.** → *Let the students sit in their places.*

## **2\. The Prohibition (النهي)**

Prohibition is used to **tell someone NOT to do something**. Instead of the **imperative verb**, prohibition uses:

* **لا \+ Present Tense Verb in Jussive Form (المجزوم)**

### **Formation of Prohibition:**

* **لا \+ فعل المضارع (Present Tense Verb in Jussive)**  
* The verb **must** be in its **jussive** form, meaning **the final vowel is dropped**.

| Meaning | Prohibition (النهي) |
| ----- | ----- |
| Don’t write\! | **لا تكتبْ\!** |
| Don’t sit\! | **لا تجلسْ\!** |
| Don’t go\! | **لا تذهبْ\!** |
| Don’t speak\! | **لا تتكلمْ\!** |

### **Examples in Sentences:**

* **لا تأكلْ بسرعة.** → *Don’t eat fast.*  
* **لا تتأخرْ عن الصلاة.** → *Don’t be late for prayer.*  
* **لا تفتحِ الباب.** → *Don’t open the door.*

## **3\. Differences Between Direct & Indirect Commands and Prohibitions**

| Type | Formation | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Direct Command** | Imperative verb | **اكتبْ الدرس\!** (Write the lesson\!) |
| **Indirect Command** | **لِ \+ present tense (jussive)** | **لْيكتبْ الدرس\!** (Let him write the lesson\!) |
| **Prohibition** | **لا \+ present tense (jussive)** | **لا تكتبْ الدرس\!** (Don’t write the lesson\!) |
